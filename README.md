# ☕ Java Projects

This repository contains multiple hands-on Java-based projects focusing on distributed systems, microservices architecture, algorithms, and optimization.

Each project demonstrates core software engineering concepts such as multithreading, concurrency, object-oriented design, real-time analytics, and scalable architecture.
